# Review Plan — Multi-Model Peer Review

Send the current feature's spec + plan to external AI models (OpenAI gpt-5.3-codex, Gemini 2.5 Pro) for independent peer review before implementation begins.

## Data Sensitivity Warning

Before running, consider whether the spec/plan contains sensitive data (PII, credentials, proprietary business logic). The review sends content to external API providers. If the project handles sensitive data, confirm with the user before proceeding.

## When to use

Run this AFTER `/speckit-plan` and `/speckit-tasks` complete, BEFORE `/speckit-implement`. This is the gate between planning and coding.

## How it works

1. Run `./scripts/review-plan.sh $ARGUMENTS` from the repo root
2. The script auto-detects the most recently modified `specs/*/plan.md` if no argument is given, or pass a specific feature dir (e.g., `specs/003-auth-flow`)
3. It sends the spec, plan, tasks, data model, and constitution to both models in parallel
4. Each model rates the plan GREEN/YELLOW/RED and lists top issues

## After the review

Present both reviews to the user with a summary:
- If all GREEN: "All reviewers approve. Safe to implement."
- If any YELLOW: "Issues flagged — review the concerns below and decide whether to fix before implementing."
- If any RED: "At least one reviewer recommends rethinking the approach. Address the RED concerns before proceeding."

If the user wants to proceed despite warnings, that's their call. The review is advisory, not blocking.
